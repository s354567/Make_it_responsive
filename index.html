                However, the term covers much more than that. Innovation is not only represented by new ideas or methods, but also by the process of discovering new ways to do things. 
                The whole process of being creative and working with each other is therefore crucial to being innovative. Inova is a newly formed company that focuses on frugal innovation. 
                As a company, we want to utilize creative minds and resolve particular needs. As a company, we arrange innovation camps to spread our knowledge and help others be innovative. 
                Our values stand strong and our main focus is being inclusive and user centered. </p>
