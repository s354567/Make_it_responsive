            <p class="text-container">We constantly hear the concept of innovation and are often taught that innovation is about creating new ideas. 
                                     However, the term covers much more than that. Innovation is not only represented by new ideas or methods, but also by the process of discovering new ways to do things. 
                                     The whole process of being creative and working with each other is therefore crucial to being innovative. Inova is a newly formed company that focuses on frugal innovation. 
                                     As a company, we want to utilize creative minds and resolve particular needs. </p>
